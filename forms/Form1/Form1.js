3. Program 3 (25%): Income Bracket
Scenario: You'll be creating a program that tells the user which tax bracket they are in for a given income. When they submit their income, their tax bracket will show. The program lets the user run it again as often as they want. 

Use this design:  
Controls are an input, a label, and two buttons.

The tax brackets are:      

Income	Tax Bracket
under $30,000	8%
$30,000 - $99,999	15%
over $99,999	25%
 

Program 3 Requirements: 

Created a new form named incomeBracket.
Used the design shown above. 
Used Bootstrap4 input, label, and button controls. 
All controls are named appropriately like we did in class (button: btnSomeName).
NO alerts, prompts, confirms, or console.logs used.
Got income from user using a control. 
Used at least one if/else statement.
Used at least one boolean operator. 
Used this format for output into a control using a template literal.
    Example: say the user input:  100000. The output would be:
             "With your income of $100000, you are in a tax bracket of 25%"
Code is all commented out. 
Program runs without error.
 

4. Remote GitHub repository
GitHub Requirements:

Publish the entire completed project to a remote GitHub repository named MidtermYourName.
Hint: just create the repository locally, then publish it to the remote all at once. Don't worry about branches. 
Submit the remote repository URL as a comment in BL.
Hand In: Submit your zipped project file and your GitHub url as a comment in BL.
